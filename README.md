# Ethereum Block Explorer

Ethereum block explorer made with React, Github Pages and MetaMask

Demo: [https://blockexp.transmute.network/](https://blockexp.transmute.network/) 

You can change the network in metamask, and the explorer will update. This is useful when you need to test multiple testnets or private nets.

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/transmute-industries/blockexp
cd blockexp
npm i
npm start
```

### Chrome Extension

If you want to add special support to the block explorer, there is a chrome extension example provided.
